			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>My name is Trey and I love playing music (specifically piano and fiddle), having quasi-philosophical discussions regarding life's complexity and/or the lack thereof, learning new things, and going on adventures. A most recent hobby of mine has been exploring the vastness of web technology. As of March, 2016, I have been living, thinking, and dreaming nothing but web, while thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.</p>

			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I have been living in South Louisiana all of my life. Born and raised in Houma, I moved to Lafayette with my mother at the age of 15.</p>
			<p>Lafayette is known for its unique <a id="animate" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajuns"><em>Cajun culture</em></a>. The Cajuns have their own food, music, french dialect/colloquialisms as well as folklore. All of these things one will quickly encounter within a day of visiting this interesting city. </p>

			<h1>More About Me</h1>
			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>Aside from web development, I love cooking, reading, and discovering new kinds of music.</p>
			<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
			<p>I'd love to make a living working as a developer for a company where everyone has similar interests and takes pride in their work. Also, having the option to work remotely would be ideal since this would allow me to integrate other things I am equally passionate about, such as traveling as a musician and exploring various cultures.</p>
			<h2>What's your background?</h2>
			<p>Before taking up an interest in web development, I have mostly studied humanities and music theory. In college I studied Anthropology at the University of New Orleans with intent on becoming an avid academic and ethnographer. I worked mostly in restuarants during this time.</p> 
			<p>After college, I decided to pursue a career in music, specifically the genres of Cajun and early Jazz, while living as minimal as possible in order to make ends meet. I also learned rudimentary carpentry skills along the way by working for my landlord.</p>
			<h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
			<p>While both music and carpentry are indeed interesting and, for the most part, fun to do, I've recently come to realize that relying on either to pay bills is quite the struggle, and this realization is precisely what led me to to start exploring other, more lucrative career paths, albeit a career that can and will help change the world for the better, and so I discovered the art of programming.</p>
