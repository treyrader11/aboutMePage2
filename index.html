			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>My name is Trey and I love playing music (specifically piano and fiddle), having quasi-philosophical discussions regarding life's complexity and/or the lack thereof, learning new things, and going on adventures. A most recent hobby of mine has been exploring the vastness of web technology. As of March, 2016, I have been living, thinking, and dreaming nothing but web, while thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.</p>

			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I have been living in South Louisiana all of my life. Born and raised in Houma, I moved to Lafayette with my mother at the age of 15.</p>
			<p>Lafayette is known for its unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajuns"><em>Cajun culture</em></a>. The Cajuns have their own food, music, french dialect/colloquialisms as well as folklore. All of which one will quickly discover within minutes of visiting this beautiful city. </p>

			<h1>More About Me</h1>
			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>Aside from web development, I love cooking, reading, and discovering new kinds of music.</p>
			<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
			<p>I'd love to make a living working from home as a developer for a top-notch  company, such as <em>Apple</em> or something. That way I'd be able to work while traveling as a musician, AND be well-compensated for it!</p>
			<h2>What's your background?</h2>
			<p>Before taking up an interest in web development, I have mostly studied humanities and music theory. In college I studied Anthropology at the University of New Orleans with intent on becoming a research professor and ethnographer. I worked mostly in restuarants during this time.</p> 
			<p>After sucessfully dropping out of college my Jr. year, I decided to pursue a career in music, specifically the genres of Cajun and early Jazz, while living as minimal as possible in order to make ends meet. I also learned rudimentary carpentry skills along the way by working for my landlord, a carpenter himself, in lieu of paying rent.</p>
			<h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
			<p>While both music and carpentry are indeed interesting and, for the most part, fun to do, I've recently come to realize that relying on either to pay bills is quite the struggle, and this realization is precisely what led me to to start exploring other, more lucrative career paths.</p> 
			<p>It was my good programmer buddy who then introduced me to the beauty of the web, and almost immediately after exploring HTML, CSS, and very basic javaScript concepts, I was able to very easily see myself one day becoming a proficient programmer!</p>
